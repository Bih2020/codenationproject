    <p>Strenghts of final projects

        1. The questions given for me to provide answers for them can be found on a single page.
        2. Different colours have been used to make the different sections in the website visible for
         someone browsing through the website to see.
        
        Weaknesses of my website
        
        1. It is not properly structured.
        2. The sentences are not clearly written because I was trying to catch up with deadline for submission.
        3. The website does not look beautiful because I have not used enough styles to make it look beautiful.</p>
