   <p>File types for my website are: JPEG, JPG, SVG and GIF
    1. JPEG is good when saving photographs because they capable of shrinking and be used on the website without losing its quality. A shrunk image means that it requires less resources to load. On the other hand, they are not the best for graphics and texts because graphics and text become blurry when saved in JPEG.
    
    2. Text and graphics should be saved in PNGs and GIFs.
    3. SVGs are vector based formats perfect for graphics because you can create full resolution images that will look good on any screen size. SVGs can be animated too like GIFs.
