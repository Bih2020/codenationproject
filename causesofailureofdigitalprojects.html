    <p6>Digital projects fail from a combination of various factors.

        1. Lack of proper planning and unwise decisions.
        2. Failure to fully understand the need of the business. They did not identify the needs from the perspective of the customer.
        3. Some leaders in the organisation refuse to give their concern to the project at the planning stage of the project.
        4. The project fails if it did not start with a business requirement or customer need.</p6>
