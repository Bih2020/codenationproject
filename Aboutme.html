   <h>About Me</h> 
   <br>
   <p>I have a background in science (Geology and Environmental Science). I also have a degree in Business Management.
     I love selling reason I run a little online business called
     <a href="https://ucustomisemi.com/"> Ucustomise MI</a>
    I built the website myself by draggin and dropping templates with a web host to acquire the fundamental knowledge on how websites
     are built. I want to further understand the building of websites by building a website from scratch without the use of a web host. 
    Learning this course will make this achievable. This course will also help me to understand GDPR that  is needed in online store
     that collects and stores private information. This will also put me on the same side of the law as I build websites for personal consumption
      or for a third party in the future.</p>
